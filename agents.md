# Building Agentic Applications with DSPy, Arcade.dev, and FastMCP

## Introduction

Agentic applications are AI-driven systems that **not only converse, but take actions** on behalf of users. This includes tasks like writing code, managing developer workflows, and performing multi-step operations across tools. In this strategy, we leverage three key technologies to build a robust agentic platform:

* **DSPy (Declarative Self-Improving Python):** A framework for constructing modular reasoning pipelines with language models. DSPy lets us program LLM behavior with **structured code instead of brittle prompts**. It abstracts prompt handling, tool usage, and multi-step reasoning into high-level modules, enabling reliable and optimizable AI logic.
* **Arcade.dev Tool Connectors:** Arcade is a secure **AI tool-calling platform** that provides **authenticated integrations** ("tools") to external services like Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc. Using Arcade’s connectors, our agent can safely perform external actions (send emails, create issues, post messages) with the user’s credentials – **no token management headaches** because Arcade handles OAuth and permissioning.
* **FastMCP API Backend:** FastMCP is a Pythonic framework for exposing our agent via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** – essentially a standardized API for LLM tools. FastMCP makes it simple to create an API server that LLM-based apps can interact with, **abstracting away protocol complexity**. The MCP interface acts like a *“USB-C port for AI”*, providing a uniform way to connect our agent to other systems. We will use FastMCP to serve our agent as an API, allowing easy integration and testing.

**Key Features and Benefits:**

* *Declarative Reasoning Pipelines:* Use DSPy to define the agent’s thought process (e.g. ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation) in a **modular, maintainable way**. This yields better reliability and easier debugging than giant prompt strings.
* *Secure Tool Integrations:* With Arcade’s pre-built connectors, the agent can interface with real services (Slack, GitHub, Jira, etc.) **securely and seamlessly**. OAuth credentials are managed by Arcade, so our codebase never directly handles sensitive tokens. This enables complex developer workflows (commit code, send notifications, update tickets) without security risks.
* *Standardized API Interface:* FastMCP allows exposing the agent’s capabilities through a well-defined protocol. This makes our backend **accessible to front-end apps or other agents** in a consistent way. Developers can call our agent API to get answers or trigger actions, and even chain it with other MCP-compatible tools for larger systems. The FastMCP server can also produce an OpenAPI spec for documentation, and integrates with FastAPI for web serving.
* *Modularity and Testability:* We structure the project into logical components – pipeline logic, tool wrappers, and API layer – each of which can be unit-tested in isolation. This modular design means we can **extend or modify** parts (e.g. add a new tool or swap the LLM) without breaking the whole system. We include unit tests to validate each component’s behavior.
* *Optimized for Coding Assistance:* The use case centers on developer assistance – our agent can answer coding questions, generate code with explanations, run test snippets, manage GitHub issues, and coordinate team communications. By combining LLM reasoning with tool execution, it can handle tasks like, *“Draft a Python function for X and open a GitHub issue with the code, then notify the team on Slack.”* This showcases broad capabilities across coding and DevOps workflows, all within one agent.

## Architectural Overview

Our agentic system consists of three main layers: the **Reasoning Pipeline**, the **Tool Connectors**, and the **API Backend**. Below is an overview of how these components interact and the data flow between them:

* **1. Client Request:** A user (or client application) sends a request to our agent’s API. For example, a request could be: *“Please create a GitHub issue titled 'Bug in data pipeline' with the following description, and post a Slack message about it in #dev-channel.”* This request hits our FastMCP-powered API endpoint.
* **2. FastMCP API Backend:** The FastMCP server receives the request via an MCP tool invocation or HTTP call. It routes the input into our agent’s logic. FastMCP handles the session and protocol details, so we can focus on what the agent should do. In our implementation, we define an MCP **tool** (or endpoint) like `agent_tool(query: str, user_id: str) -> str` which acts as the entry point to the agent. The `user_id` helps us identify the user's credentials for tool use.
* **3. DSPy Reasoning Pipeline:** The `agent_tool` passes the query to the DSPy pipeline. The pipeline is defined using DSPy’s declarative modules – in this case, likely a `dspy.ReAct` agent or a custom DSPy `Module` that implements a reasoning loop. This agent **interprets the query and decides on actions**. DSPy allows the agent to break the task into steps (e.g. think -> decide to use a tool -> get result -> continue thinking). The pipeline has a set of **Tool Functions** registered (like `send_slack_message`, `create_github_issue`, etc.), which the agent can call during its reasoning process.
* **4. Tool Connectors (Arcade Integrations):** When the agent decides to use an external tool, it invokes the corresponding Python function in our connectors module. For example, the agent’s chain-of-thought might produce an **Action** like “Call SlackTool.send\_message with channel='#dev-channel' and message='Issue created: ...'”. The DSPy framework will then execute our `send_message` function. Inside that function, we leverage Arcade or external APIs to perform the action. Each tool connector is designed to be **self-contained and secure**:

  * For tools that require authentication (almost all do), the connector ensures a valid token is available. **Arcade’s auth flow** can be used here – e.g., our backend might have already obtained a Slack OAuth token for `user_id` via Arcade’s `client.auth.start()` flow, and we have it stored securely (or Arcade stores it internally). The tool function retrieves the token (from a secure store or Arcade context) and calls the external service.
  * The actual API call is made (e.g. an HTTPS request to Slack’s API or through Arcade’s proxy). We do this call **server-side**, so we keep secrets hidden and can handle errors.
  * The tool function returns the result (or a summary of the action) back to the DSPy agent. For instance, `send_message` might return a confirmation like `"Slack message sent to #dev-channel."` The agent then incorporates this into its reasoning.
* **5. LLM Reasoning & Continuation:** The DSPy agent receives the tool’s result and continues the reasoning loop. It may decide additional steps are needed. For example, after creating a GitHub issue via the GitHub tool, the agent might take the issue URL from the result and then call the Slack tool to post it. DSPy’s ReAct orchestration manages this loop up to a certain number of iterations or until the agent concludes the task.
* **6. Final Response:** Once the agent has completed all necessary steps, it produces a final answer or confirmation. In a coding Q\&A scenario, this might be an answer with a code snippet. In an action scenario, it might be a summary of what was done (“I created the issue and notified the team.”). This final response is returned by the DSPy pipeline to the API layer.
* **7. API Response:** The FastMCP server sends the result back to the client. If using MCP streamable mode, intermediate actions or streaming content could also be sent in real-time (FastMCP supports streaming responses). But typically, the client just receives the final answer or outcome. The **MCP standard** ensures this interaction is in a format any compliant client (or even Arcade’s own systems) can understand and further integrate.

**Component Boundaries & Data Flow:**

* *LLM vs Tool Execution:* The language model (LLM) part of the agent (managed by DSPy) is responsible for **decision-making and content generation**. It decides *what* to do and formulates responses. However, it cannot directly perform external actions – that’s where the tool connectors come in. The LLM’s intent to use a tool is translated into a function call (via DSPy’s tooling interface), and our code executes that call. This separation means the LLM never sees raw API keys or OAuth tokens; it only sees the results of actions. This design **sandboxes the LLM** and protects credentials.
* *Tool Connector Security:* Each connector acts as a **boundary** between the agent and external service. Connectors validate inputs and use stored credentials securely. For example, the Slack connector ensures the channel name and message are properly formatted and uses a token tied to the `user_id` (retrieved via Arcade’s secure storage) to authenticate the API call. If a token is missing or expired, the connector could throw an error prompting re-auth (which might be handled out-of-band through Arcade’s OAuth flow).
* *MCP Server vs Internal Logic:* The FastMCP server provides the **public interface** (network API) but internally delegates to our agent logic. This keeps our core logic independent of the web framework. In fact, we could swap FastMCP for another API system (or run in a notebook) and the DSPy + connectors would work the same. Conversely, by conforming to MCP, we gain flexibility: any MCP-compatible client or even Arcade’s cloud can call our agent as a tool. (For instance, we could register our agent as a custom MCP tool in Arcade, allowing other agents to invoke it, showing the power of standardization.)

In summary, the architecture cleanly separates concerns: **DSPy for thought, Arcade for action, FastMCP for interaction**. This results in a powerful agent that can handle a broad range of developer-centric tasks in a secure and modular fashion.

## Phased Implementation Strategy

Building this system from scratch can be tackled in phases, ensuring we incrementally add functionality and maintain testability:

1. **Project Setup and Dependencies:** Initialize a Python project (e.g. a git repo or folder) for the agent. Set up a virtual environment and install necessary libraries:

   * `dspy` (DSPy) for the reasoning framework.
   * `arcadepy` (Arcade’s Python client) and/or `openai` (if using Arcade via OpenAI-compatible endpoints).
   * `fastmcp` for the MCP server.
   * Additional libs for HTTP requests (if needed, e.g. `requests` for calling external APIs) and testing (`pytest`).
   * In this phase, also set up configuration management for API keys and credentials. For example, use environment variables for `ARCADE_API_KEY`, and any service-specific tokens if needed. Since Arcade will manage OAuth tokens per user, our app might only need the Arcade API key and possibly Slack/GitHub client IDs if doing custom flows. Create a `config.py` to load these from env and make them accessible.
   * Outcome of Phase 1: a basic scaffolding of the project (folders for connectors, pipeline, api, tests) and all dependencies installed.

2. **Implement Tool Connector Wrappers:** Develop the connectors for external tools as simple, testable Python classes or functions. For our developer assistant use-case, start with a couple of key tools:

   * *Slack Connector:* A class (e.g. `SlackTool`) with methods to send messages (and possibly other interactions like reading channel history if needed). This will use Arcade or Slack API under the hood. To keep it simple, you might use Slack’s web API via an OAuth token. In development, you can obtain a Slack bot token or user token (Arcade can facilitate this). The `SlackTool.send_message(channel, text)` method will format an HTTP request to Slack (e.g. POST to `chat.postMessage`) with the proper auth header. Ensure it returns a confirmation or result string.
   * *GitHub Connector:* A class (e.g. `GitHubTool`) to create issues or pull data from GitHub. For example, `GitHubTool.create_issue(repo, title, body)` could call GitHub’s REST API to create a new issue in the given repository. Again, an OAuth token or personal access token is needed – Arcade’s GitHub integration can supply this once the user authorizes it. The method should return something like the new issue URL or ID.
   * *(Optional) Code Execution Tool:* For coding assistance, consider adding a tool to run code snippets safely. Arcade offers a Code Sandbox integration (for running code in a container) which could be used. Alternatively, you can implement a limited local sandbox using the Python `exec` for small snippets, but caution is needed for security. If using Arcade’s CodeSandbox tool, you would invoke it similar to other tools (Arcade would handle running the code in an isolated environment).
   * Each connector should be **self-contained**: handle its API calls, error cases (e.g. network failures or permission errors), and not rely on global state except config. Write **unit tests** for each tool method by mocking external calls. For instance, test that `SlackTool.send_message` constructs the correct HTTP request given certain inputs, and that it correctly parses a success or failure response. (We will provide example test code in a later section.)
   * Outcome of Phase 2: A `connectors/` module with working Slack and GitHub tool classes (and any others), along with tests ensuring they behave correctly in isolation.

3. **Build the DSPy Reasoning Pipeline:** Next, construct the agent’s reasoning workflow using DSPy.

   * Start by defining the overall **signature** of the task. For example, if our agent takes a query and returns a response, we can define `signature = "query: str -> answer: str"`. DSPy allows signatures that specify input/output types for clarity.
   * Decide on the approach: a straightforward way is to use **ReAct (Reason+Act)** pattern, which DSPy supports out-of-the-box. The DSPy `dspy.ReAct` class can be initialized with a list of tool functions and will manage an LLM loop that interleaves thoughts and actions. We simply provide it the tools (as Python callables) and a max iteration limit. For example: `agent = dspy.ReAct(signature, tools=[slack_tool.send_message, github_tool.create_issue], max_iters=5)`. This means the agent’s prompt will be set up to use those two tools during its reasoning.
   * Alternatively, for more complex logic, we could define a custom `dspy.Module` class. For instance, we could create a `DeveloperAssistantModule` that first uses an LLM submodule to classify the query (is it asking for code advice, or to perform an action?), then either generates a pure answer or calls the relevant tool. DSPy’s composability would let us chain a **retrieval step** (e.g. search documentation) before answering, or a **planning step** before execution. However, this adds complexity. We might begin with a simpler ReAct agent and iterate later.
   * Configure the LLM for DSPy: in code, you’ll initialize a language model for DSPy to use. DSPy can work with OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc. For example, `lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4', api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)` and then `dspy.configure(lm=lm)`. (In Arcade’s context, if using their hosted model endpoint, you might configure an LM with the Arcade base URL or use an open model for development.)
   * Test the pipeline in isolation. You can write a simple script or use a notebook to feed sample queries to `agent(query="...")` and see the outputs. Without hooking up the API yet, ensure the agent can utilize the tools: e.g., ask it *“Post a hello message to Slack channel general.”* and watch if it correctly calls `SlackTool.send_message`. This might require providing few-shot examples in the prompt to guide the agent’s use of tools (DSPy likely handles prompt assembly for ReAct, but you may need to supply tool descriptions or examples).
   * If the agent’s initial performance is not optimal (maybe the LLM doesn’t always know when to use tools), DSPy offers optimization techniques. You can use **DSPy optimizers** to fine-tune prompts or weights, or provide feedback for improvement. This could be a later enhancement: e.g., use DSPy’s data-driven optimization to refine how the agent uses the Slack/GitHub tools by running test scenarios.
   * Outcome of Phase 3: A fully functional agent pipeline (`pipeline.py`) that can handle incoming requests and orchestrate tool usage via DSPy. Basic manual tests (or automated with mocked LLM) confirm that logic works.

4. **Integrate with FastMCP API Backend:** With the core logic ready, expose it through an API server using FastMCP.

   * Initialize a FastMCP server in an `api/server.py` module. For example:

     ```python
     from fastmcp import FastMCP
     mcp = FastMCP("DevAgent")  # name our server
     ```

     We then use decorators to expose functions. We can expose a single tool that encapsulates the agent’s functionality:

     ```python
     @mcp.tool()
     def agent_tool(query: str, user_id: str) -> str:
         """Handle a developer query with the agent and return the result."""
         return run_agent(query, user_id)
     ```

     Here, `run_agent` is a helper that calls our DSPy pipeline (as built in Phase 3). It will also likely initialize or load the tool connectors and pass in the `user_id` for context.
   * The `user_id` is important: it ties to Arcade’s auth context. In practice, when a client calls our API, they would include a user identifier (could be an email or a UUID) that our system uses to fetch that user’s OAuth tokens (via Arcade). Arcade’s model API expects a `user` field as well so that it knows which user’s credentials to apply. We mirror that concept here. (If we were deploying on Arcade’s platform directly, the `user_id` could be managed by them, but in our standalone agent we handle it.)
   * Add any **resources** if needed: FastMCP allows defining resources (read-only data endpoints) via `@mcp.resource()`. For example, we could expose a resource for documentation or code context if our agent needs to load them. But for now, our agent self-contains retrieval via tools or prompt.
   * **Run the server:** In development, you can simply call `mcp.run()` to start the MCP server (it uses an async server under the hood). This will listen for MCP-formatted requests. For debugging or in absence of an MCP client, FastMCP can integrate with FastAPI: using `mcp.include_router(app)` on a FastAPI app to expose endpoints (it can auto-generate REST endpoints for tools). This gives flexibility to call the agent via HTTP (e.g. POST `/tools/agent_tool` with JSON payload). We can use that for testing and later deployment behind a web server.
   * Test the API locally. You might use the **MCP Inspector** (a dev tool provided by FastMCP) or simply simulate a call by invoking `agent_tool` function directly in a test. Ensure that a sample input flows through to the pipeline and returns expected output. We will add integration tests to confirm the end-to-end behavior (with connectors possibly stubbed out).
   * Outcome of Phase 4: The agent is now a running service. We have an API endpoint that external clients (or even cURL) can hit to get responses or trigger actions. At this stage, we effectively have a *local ChatGPT that can write code and also perform actions in our developer tools*.

5. **Unit Testing and QA:** Throughout development, we create **unit tests** for each component:

   * Tests for **tool connectors** ensure that API calls are formed correctly and that the functions handle responses. Use Python’s `unittest.mock` or `pytest` monkeypatch to simulate API responses from Slack/GitHub. For example, test that `SlackTool.send_message` returns a success message when the Slack API responds with `"ok": true`, and that it raises an error or returns a failure message when Slack returns an error.
   * Tests for **pipeline logic** can mock the tool functions to verify the agent’s decision-making. For instance, you could stub `slack_tool.send_message` to simply return a known string, and then give the agent a prompt that should trigger a Slack message. Validate that the final output contains the expected confirmation. Testing LLM-driven logic is tricky due to nondeterminism, but you can configure DSPy to use a specific smaller model or a fixed random seed for reproducibility. Another approach is to monkeypatch the LLM call in DSPy to return a preset sequence of thoughts/actions (essentially simulating the LLM’s behavior) – this way you can test the control flow without needing the actual model.
   * Tests for **API layer** use FastMCP’s test capabilities. If using FastAPI integration, you can use the FastAPI TestClient to POST to the endpoint and check the response. If sticking to MCP calls, you might use the `fastmcp.Client` in testing to send a request. Simulate a full scenario: e.g., call the `agent_tool` with a payload that should create a GitHub issue (but monkeypatch `GitHubTool.create_issue` to not hit real API) and check that the final returned message contains the issue URL stub from your fake response.
   * We ensure test coverage especially for security-related logic (tokens handling, error paths) and the critical path of a user request -> tool call -> response.
   * Outcome of Phase 5: A robust test suite covering connectors, pipeline, and API. This gives confidence to refactor or extend the system later. We can run `pytest` (or another runner) to validate everything at each change.

6. **Deployment and Scaling:** Finally, prepare the system for deployment in a production-like environment.

   * Choose a hosting strategy: because FastMCP can integrate as an ASGI app (FastAPI), we can containerize the app with Uvicorn/Gunicorn. Alternatively, we could run the MCP server directly. For flexibility, let’s assume we wrap it in FastAPI. We create an `app = FastAPI()` and do `mcp.include_router(app)` to add MCP routes, then run Uvicorn server serving this `app`. This allows standard HTTP calls and easy compatibility with load balancers or API gateways.
   * **Configuration:** Use environment variables or a config file for all secrets: Arcade API keys, Slack signing secrets (if needed), etc. Never hardcode secrets in code. If deploying via Docker/Kubernetes, use a secrets manager or vault to inject these. Ensure the OAuth redirect URIs for Arcade integrations point to the right domain if user auth flows are involved.
   * **Arcade Credentials Management:** For any OAuth-based tool (which is most of them), the first time a user (identified by `user_id`) uses the agent, an authorization step is needed. In a production app, you might implement endpoints to initiate and complete the OAuth dance using Arcade’s SDK. For example, when an auth is needed, your agent could respond with a message or error indicating authorization required, and your frontend could redirect the user to the URL from `client.auth.start()`. After the user grants permission, Arcade stores the token and our agent can proceed. In deployment, have a strategy for this: perhaps a pre-onboarding step where users connect their Slack/GitHub via Arcade’s UI or API.
   * **Monitoring and Logging:** Deploy with logging enabled to trace agent decisions and tool usage. DSPy can integrate with MLflow for tracing prompts and performance, which is useful in debugging the agent’s behavior. Arcade also provides logs for tool calls in its dashboard. Use these to monitor usage and catch issues (like the agent getting stuck in loops or failing to use a tool correctly).
   * **Scaling:** The service can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances behind a load balancer. Because each request is largely self-contained (MCP can maintain session if needed, but sessions could be sticky by user), it scales like a stateless web service. Ensure the LLM calls (to OpenAI or others) are the main latency; use streaming to send partial results if response time is long. If using local models for DSPy, scale up nodes with GPU as needed.
   * **Security:** Only expose the necessary endpoints. If the FastMCP server is public, consider adding an authentication layer (e.g., API keys or OAuth) for clients to prevent unauthorized use. Arcade ensures the tools perform actions with proper auth, but you don’t want random users hitting your agent and causing it to use someone’s credentials. Typically, you’d have the user authenticated to your system and map their identity to `user_id` securely.
   * Outcome of Phase 6: A deployed, accessible agent service. It can handle real-world requests in a secure manner, and we have processes for monitoring and updating it.

By following these phases, we gradually move from a simple prototype to a production-ready, tested system.

## Project Structure and Components

We organize the codebase into a modular structure for clarity and testability:

```
agentic_app/
├── connectors/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── slack_tool.py        # SlackTool class for Slack API integration
│   ├── github_tool.py       # GitHubTool class for GitHub API integration
│   └── ... (other tools like email_tool.py, code_tool.py as needed)
├── pipeline/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── agent_pipeline.py    # DSPy agent setup (modules, LLM configuration, etc.)
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── server.py            # FastMCP server definition and route exposure
├── tests/
│   ├── test_slack_tool.py
│   ├── test_github_tool.py
│   ├── test_pipeline.py
│   └── test_api.py
└── config.py                # Configuration for API keys, model settings, etc.
```

This layout separates concerns: `connectors` holds all tool-related code, `pipeline` contains the AI reasoning logic, and `api` deals with serving the agent. Each tool and the pipeline can be independently tested.

Let’s walk through the main components with code snippets and explanations:

### Tool Connector Example – Slack Integration

In `connectors/slack_tool.py`, we implement a Slack tool using Arcade’s secure integration. The SlackTool class will manage sending messages to Slack channels. We assume that OAuth tokens for Slack are managed via Arcade; our code will retrieve and use them. For simplicity, in this example we’ll accept a token (perhaps fetched from Arcade) in an environment variable or via a setter.

```python
# connectors/slack_tool.py
import os, requests

class SlackTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token = None  # Slack OAuth token for the current user, to be set after auth.

    def set_user_token(self, user_token: str):
        """Set the Slack token (e.g., retrieved via Arcade after OAuth) for this user context."""
        self.token = user_token

    def send_message(self, channel_name: str, message: str) -> str:
        """
        Send a message to a Slack channel using Slack Web API.
        Returns a confirmation string on success.
        """
        if not self.token:
            raise RuntimeError("SlackTool: No token available. User may need to authorize Slack access.")
        # Prepare Slack API call
        url = "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage"
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"
        }
        payload = {"channel": channel_name, "text": message}
        resp = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        data = resp.json()
        if resp.status_code != 200 or not data.get("ok"):
            err = data.get("error", resp.text)
            raise RuntimeError(f"Slack API call failed: {err}")
        # If successful, Slack returns the message timestamp and channel
        return f"Slack message sent to #{channel_name}"
```

In this snippet, `SlackTool.send_message` uses `requests.post` to call Slack’s `chat.postMessage` endpoint with the given channel and message. We set the OAuth token in the Authorization header. In a real deployment, you wouldn’t call Slack directly like this; instead, you could use Arcade’s tool proxy by calling the OpenAI API with `tools=["Slack.SendMessageToChannel"]`. However, that approach would invoke an LLM internally to decide the call. Here we choose a direct API call for determinism and simplicity in testing. The trade-off is we must manage the token ourselves (which we assume is provided via Arcade’s auth flow).

**GitHub Connector Example:** Similarly, in `connectors/github_tool.py` we might have:

```python
# connectors/github_tool.py
import os, requests

class GitHubTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token = None  # GitHub token (e.g., personal access or OAuth token)

    def set_user_token(self, token: str):
        self.token = token

    def create_issue(self, repo: str, title: str, body: str) -> str:
        """
        Create a GitHub issue in the given repository.
        `repo` should be in "owner/name" format.
        Returns the issue URL on success.
        """
        if not self.token:
            raise RuntimeError("GitHubTool: No token available for user.")
        url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/issues"
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.token}",
            "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json"
        }
        payload = {"title": title, "body": body}
        resp = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        if resp.status_code not in (200, 201):
            raise RuntimeError(f"GitHub API issue creation failed: {resp.status_code} - {resp.text}")
        issue_data = resp.json()
        issue_url = issue_data.get("html_url", "issue_url_not_available")
        return f"Created GitHub issue: {issue_url}"
```

This uses GitHub’s REST API to create an issue. Again, an OAuth token is expected to be set. Arcade’s GitHub integration would allow us to obtain a user token without storing passwords – we’d integrate that by calling Arcade’s auth and storing the token in a database or memory cache keyed by user. For brevity, we assume `set_user_token` is called with a valid token when the user is authenticated.

We could add more methods (e.g., `search_repos`, `comment_on_issue`) as needed. Arcade’s toolkit reference lists many such actions (e.g., in Slack we saw tools for reading messages, listing channels, etc.).

**Using Arcade for Tokens:** It’s worth noting how we envision using Arcade here. In an ideal flow:

* When a new user (with id or email) starts using our agent, our system checks if we have their Slack/GitHub tokens. If not, it uses the Arcade SDK:

  * `Arcade().auth.start(user_id, "slack", scopes=[...])` to initiate Slack OAuth. The user completes it via the provided URL, and Arcade associates the token with that user\_id.
  * We then call `Arcade().auth.wait_for_completion()` or check `auth.status` to get the token (as seen in the Arcade code example, `auth_response.context.token` gives it).
* Finally, we call `slack_tool.set_user_token(token)` to store it for the session (and ideally persist securely for future sessions).
* At runtime, whenever the agent needs to call Slack, the token is already set. If token expires, Arcade can refresh it behind the scenes or prompt re-auth.

This approach ensures **we never directly see the user’s credentials**; we only handle the OAuth token given by Arcade, which we treat carefully.

### DSPy Reasoning Pipeline

Now, in `pipeline/agent_pipeline.py`, we assemble the DSPy modules and prepare the agent. We use the Slack and GitHub tools created above. We will demonstrate using DSPy’s ReAct agent for simplicity:

```python
# pipeline/agent_pipeline.py
import dspy
from dspy import ReAct

# Import our tool connectors
from connectors.slack_tool import SlackTool
from connectors.github_tool import GitHubTool

# Initialize tools (could potentially be created per request instead of global)
slack_tool = SlackTool()
github_tool = GitHubTool()

# Define the signature for the agent: input query -> output response
AGENT_SIGNATURE = "query: str -> response: str"

# Create the ReAct agent with available tools
agent = ReAct(AGENT_SIGNATURE, tools=[slack_tool.send_message, github_tool.create_issue], max_iters=5)

# Optionally, configure the language model for DSPy (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4)
# Here we assume OPENAI_API_KEY is set in env for an OpenAI model, or Arcade’s model proxy.
import os
openai_model = os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-3.5-turbo")
openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if openai_api_key:
    dspy.settings.configure(openai_model=openai_model, openai_api_key=openai_api_key)
# If using a local model or other provider, configure accordingly.

def run_agent(query: str, user_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Execute the agent on the given query and user context.
    This sets up user-specific credentials and runs the DSPy pipeline.
    """
    # Retrieve and set user tokens for each tool (in a real app, from a secure store or Arcade)
    slack_token = os.getenv(f"SLACK_TOKEN_{user_id}")
    github_token = os.getenv(f"GITHUB_TOKEN_{user_id}")
    if slack_token:
        slack_tool.set_user_token(slack_token)
    if github_token:
        github_tool.set_user_token(github_token)
    # Run the agent reasoning pipeline
    try:
        result = agent(query=query)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle exceptions gracefully, perhaps return an error message
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
    return result
```

Some important notes on this pipeline code:

* We create global instances of `SlackTool` and `GitHubTool`. This is for simplicity; in a multi-user setting we might create new tool instances per request or use a context to avoid cross-user data. However, since we set tokens per request, using global instances is manageable (but not thread-safe if modified concurrently – in a real deployment, better to instantiate inside `run_agent` or ensure thread safety).
* We configure the LLM via `dspy.settings.configure`. Here we use an OpenAI model name. If we were integrating with Arcade’s hosted model that auto-calls tools, we might instead point `openai_api_base` to Arcade’s API. For example:

  ```python
  import litellm  # DSPy uses litellm under the hood for OpenAI calls
  litellm.openai.api_base = "https://api.arcade-ai.com" 
  ```

  and use Arcade’s provided model like `"gpt-4o-mini"`. But since we have our own tool logic, we can use the standard API. In testing, one might use a smaller local model for speed.
* The `run_agent` function prepares the context (setting the tokens for the tools based on the user). We used environment variables like `SLACK_TOKEN_<user>` just as a placeholder – in practice, you’d query a database or cache where you stored the OAuth tokens from Arcade’s auth step. If a token is missing, the tools will raise an error which we catch and return as an error message (the client could interpret that as a cue to initiate auth).
* We wrap the `agent(query=query)` call in a try/except to handle any exceptions from the tools or DSPy. This ensures the API returns a controlled error message rather than crashing.

With this pipeline, whenever `agent()` is invoked:

* DSPy will prompt the LLM with the user’s query and a predefined instruction set that includes how to call `slack_tool.send_message` and `github_tool.create_issue` (likely DSPy auto-generates a format like: Tool usage: `send_message["channel_name", "message"]` in the ReAct prompt).
* The LLM will produce either a direct answer or an action. If it outputs an action (DSPy’s ReAct will detect the pattern), DSPy will call the corresponding Python function (our tool). The function executes (e.g., sends a Slack message) and returns a result string.
* DSPy then feeds that result back into the LLM’s context (as observation) and continues the loop. This repeats until the LLM outputs a final answer (marked by a special token or just by convention of not calling a tool).
* The final answer is then returned by `agent()`. DSPy’s ReAct manages the prompt history and formatting internally, which greatly simplifies our code.

**Example usage:** Suppose the user query is: *“I finished implementing feature X. Please open a GitHub issue titled 'Feature X Code Review', assign it to me, and notify #dev team on Slack.”*
The agent’s reasoning might go like:

```
Thought: The user wants to create a GitHub issue and then send a Slack message. I have tools for that.
Action: Call create_issue with repo='myorg/myrepo', title='Feature X Code Review', body='(some default body or pulled from context)'
Observation: Created GitHub issue: https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/issues/123
Thought: Now I should notify the dev team on Slack with this link.
Action: Call send_message with channel_name='dev', message='Code review needed: Feature X (see issue #123 at ...)'
Observation: Slack message sent to #dev
Thought: All tasks done. I should respond to the user.
Answer: "I've opened an issue 'Feature X Code Review' on GitHub and posted a notification in #dev channel."
```

All of this is handled within `agent()`, orchestrated by DSPy’s ReAct agent using our tool functions.

### FastMCP API Server

Finally, in `api/server.py`, we set up the FastMCP server to expose the agent as an API endpoint. As discussed, we’ll create an MCP tool for the agent:

```python
# api/server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from pipeline.agent_pipeline import run_agent

mcp = FastMCP("AgenticDevAssistant")

@mcp.tool()
def agent_tool(query: str, user_id: str) -> str:
    """
    MCP Tool: Processes a user query through the agent.
    """
    return run_agent(query, user_id)

# Optionally, expose a resource or an OpenAPI description if needed
# e.g., a health check or the agent's OpenAPI spec (FastMCP can generate one).

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the MCP server (for local testing)
    mcp.run()
```

With this setup, running `python api/server.py` will start the FastMCP server (listening on a default port, typically 6789 or similar – FastMCP will log it). The `agent_tool` function is now callable via MCP. For instance, if using the FastMCP CLI or inspector, you could call something like:

```
fastmcp call agent_tool '{"query": "Hello", "user_id": "user@example.com"}'
```

and get a response.

To integrate with HTTP for wider compatibility, we can use FastAPI:

```python
# Integrate with FastAPI for HTTP access (if needed for deployment behind REST)
from fastmcp.contrib.fastapi import router as mcp_router
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI(title="Agentic Dev Assistant API")
app.include_router(mcp_router(mcp), prefix="/mcp")
```

This will provide endpoints such as `POST /mcp/tools/agent_tool` accepting JSON with `"query"` and `"user_id"`. It also generates docs for these endpoints.

**FastMCP Tool Design:** We chose to expose a single tool `agent_tool` that does everything. This is simple for clients to use (just one call). Alternatively, we could expose **multiple tools** corresponding to sub-functions of the agent. For example, one tool could be `ask_code_question(question: str)` and another `perform_task(description: str)`. Internally both might call `run_agent` with different prompt prefixes. This kind of partition could make sense if we want to have specialized endpoints (one that guarantees no external actions, just Q\&A, vs one that allows actions). For now, one general endpoint is sufficient, and we can include parameters in the query to indicate what the user wants.

**Security & Authorization:** In `agent_tool`, we trust the `user_id` provided. In a real system, that would likely come from an authenticated context (e.g., a JWT or session that maps to user\_id). We might integrate FastMCP with an auth mechanism to ensure not just anyone can call our agent with someone else’s user\_id. FastMCP’s `Authentication` docs could be used to secure the endpoint (for example, requiring an API key to call, or running behind a firewall).

### Unit Testing Examples

We emphasize testing for each part. Here are brief examples of how we might test our components:

**Testing SlackTool with a mocked HTTP call:**

```python
# tests/test_slack_tool.py
import pytest, json
from connectors.slack_tool import SlackTool

def test_send_message_success(monkeypatch):
    tool = SlackTool()
    fake_token = "xoxb-fake-token"
    tool.set_user_token(fake_token)
    # Monkeypatch requests.post to simulate Slack API
    called = {}
    def fake_post(url, json=None, headers=None):
        # Check that the correct URL and auth are used
        assert url == "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage"
        assert headers["Authorization"] == f"Bearer {fake_token}"
        assert json["channel"] == "general"
        assert json["text"] == "hello"
        # Simulate Slack success response
        class DummyResp:
            status_code = 200
            def __init__(self):
                self._json = {"ok": True, "ts": "123.456", "channel": "general"}
            def json(self):
                return self._json
        called['posted'] = True
        return DummyResp()
    monkeypatch.setattr("requests.post", fake_post)
    result = tool.send_message("general", "hello")
    assert called.get('posted') is True
    assert result == "Slack message sent to #general"

def test_send_message_failure(monkeypatch):
    tool = SlackTool()
    tool.set_user_token("some-token")
    # Simulate Slack returning an error (e.g., invalid_auth)
    def fake_post(url, json=None, headers=None):
        class DummyResp:
            status_code = 200
            def json(self):
                return {"ok": False, "error": "invalid_auth"}
        return DummyResp()
    monkeypatch.setattr("requests.post", fake_post)
    with pytest.raises(RuntimeError) as exc:
        tool.send_message("general", "hi")
    assert "invalid_auth" in str(exc.value)
```

In these tests, we use `monkeypatch` to override `requests.post` so no real HTTP call is made. We check that our function constructs the request correctly and handles the response properly. Similar tests would be written for `GitHubTool.create_issue` (mocking `requests.post` to GitHub’s API).

**Testing the DSPy Pipeline:**

Testing the full agent pipeline is more challenging due to the LLM involvement. One approach is to monkeypatch DSPy’s ReAct internals or the `agent` object to force certain behavior. Alternatively, we can use a dummy small model for predictable output. For example, if we configure `openai_model='gpt-3.5-turbo'` but provide an invalid API key in tests, we could monkeypatch `dspy.LM.call` to return a fixed response. However, since DSPy is declarative, a simpler method is to test our integration points:

* Test that when a tool raises an exception, `run_agent` catches it and returns an error string.
* Test that if no tools are needed (just a question answer), the agent returns a reasonable string. (This might be more of an integration test with a real or stubbed LLM.)

We can also simulate a scenario by patching our tool functions to not actually call APIs, and then see if `agent(query)` attempts to call them:

```python
# tests/test_pipeline.py
from pipeline.agent_pipeline import agent, slack_tool, github_tool

def test_agent_calls_tools(monkeypatch):
    # Monkeypatch tool functions to observe calls
    called = {"slack": False, "github": False}
    def fake_send_message(channel, msg):
        called["slack"] = True
        return "SLACK_SENT"
    def fake_create_issue(repo, title, body):
        called["github"] = True
        return "ISSUE_CREATED"
    monkeypatch.setattr(slack_tool, "send_message", fake_send_message)
    monkeypatch.setattr(github_tool, "create_issue", fake_create_issue)
    # Monkeypatch the LLM to a dummy that always decides to call both tools in order.
    # For simplicity, assume our agent will always call create_issue then send_message for this test query.
    # (In practice, we'd need to force the LLM output sequence or use a canned prompt.)
    # You might monkeypatch dspy.ReAct._call_llm or similar internal to control output, which is advanced.
    # Here we directly call tool functions to simulate a scenario:
    res1 = github_tool.create_issue("org/repo", "Test Issue", "Body")
    res2 = slack_tool.send_message("general", "Test message")
    assert res1 == "ISSUE_CREATED" and res2 == "SLACK_SENT"
    assert called["github"] and called["slack"]
```

The above is a bit contrived – effectively we’re not running the real agent, just ensuring our monkeypatches work. A more thorough test would require deeper integration or acceptance testing with a real small model.

**Testing the FastMCP API:**

If we integrate with FastAPI, we can do:

```python
# tests/test_api.py
from api.server import app
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

client = TestClient(app)

def test_agent_tool_endpoint(monkeypatch):
    # Patch run_agent to avoid calling the real pipeline
    from pipeline import agent_pipeline
    def dummy_run_agent(query, user_id):
        # Just echo back for test
        return f"Received: {query} for {user_id}"
    monkeypatch.setattr(agent_pipeline, "run_agent", dummy_run_agent)
    # Call the API endpoint
    resp = client.post("/mcp/tools/agent_tool", json={"query": "Hello", "user_id": "test-user"})
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    # The MCP FastAPI router wraps response in a standard format
    # It might look like: {"result": "Received: Hello for test-user"}
    assert "Received: Hello" in str(data)
```

This uses FastAPI’s test client to simulate an HTTP call to our MCP endpoint. We monkeypatch `run_agent` to isolate the test (not invoking the whole pipeline). The test then verifies we got the expected output structure.

With these tests in place, we run them regularly to ensure nothing is broken by refactors. They serve as documentation of expected behaviors as well.

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying this agentic system, consider the following:

* **Environment & Infrastructure:** Containerize the application with all dependencies. Ensure the container has access to any necessary runtime (if using local LLMs, include model files; if using OpenAI API, ensure the key is provided). If using GPU for local models, configure the container accordingly. Decide where to host (cloud VM, Kubernetes cluster, etc.). The FastAPI + FastMCP combo can be served behind a secure API gateway.
* **Arcade Service:** You can either use Arcade’s cloud API (api.arcade-ai.com) with their provided model (like GPT-4o) to handle tool calls, or self-host the agent as we did. We chose to self-host the reasoning and directly call Slack/GitHub. An alternative deployment is to **host this agent on Arcade**: Arcade allows custom MCP tools, so we could deploy our agent as an MCP server and register it with Arcade. That would let Arcade’s orchestrator call our agent as if it were one of its tools, possibly leveraging Arcade’s scaling and auth. This might be overkill for now, but it’s an option for future integration.
* **Secrets Management:** Use a robust secrets store for API keys (Arcade API key, OpenAI key, etc.). Our config uses env variables, which is fine if those are injected securely (like via Docker secrets or CI/CD). The OAuth tokens for Slack/GitHub (per user) need secure storage as well. Arcade can store tokens in its system tied to user\_id (so you might not need to persist them yourself). If you do store them, encrypt them at rest.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Enable logging for each layer. The tool connectors should log at least warnings or errors when external calls fail. The agent pipeline can log each step of reasoning (maybe at debug level, since it can be verbose). FastMCP and FastAPI will log request accesses. Use monitoring tools to track usage: how many issues created, messages sent, etc., to catch any runaway behaviors or misuse.
* **Handling Failures Gracefully:** In production, the agent should handle exceptions gracefully and return useful info. For example, if Slack is down or token expired, catch that and respond with something like “I couldn’t post to Slack (authorization failed).” So the user knows to re-auth or check permissions. Implement timeouts for tool calls (so the agent doesn’t hang if an API is slow). Possibly utilize DSPy’s ability to set a timeout on LLM calls or max iterations to avoid infinite loops.
* **Future Extensions:** Our design supports adding new tools easily. To add a Jira integration, you’d create `JiraTool` class, implement methods (create ticket, update ticket, etc.), then include it in the agent’s tool list and signature. Because of the modular structure, this won’t affect existing tools. You can also create specialized pipelines (like a sub-agent for coding that uses a code execution tool and a different prompt style, while another sub-agent handles project management tasks). They can be orchestrated by a higher-level module that delegates to the right sub-agent (a *manager agent* pattern).
* **Phased Rollout:** When first deploying, consider a beta mode where actions are either logged or require confirmation. For instance, the agent could be set to “read-only” where it drafts what it *would* do (like “Draft: Slack message X, GitHub issue Y”) without actually executing, until trust is built. This can prevent unintended side-effects if the LLM misinterprets something. Gradually enable full action mode in production when confident.

By addressing these considerations, we ensure the agentic application is not only powerful and flexible but also reliable and secure in a real-world setting.

In conclusion, we have outlined a comprehensive implementation of an agentic system that uses **DSPy for intelligent orchestration**, **Arcade.dev for safe tool integration**, and **FastMCP for a standardized API interface**. This system is well-suited for coding assistance and developer workflows, capable of answering questions, writing code, and performing actions across external services. The provided strategy and code scaffolding can be used as a foundation to build and deploy a production-grade AI assistant that truly “**gets work done**” on behalf of its users, going far beyond a chat-based helper.
